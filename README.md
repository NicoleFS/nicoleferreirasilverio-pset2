For this assignment I created an app with which you can play one or multiple games of MadLibs. The game randomly chooses
one out of five texts in which the user is asked to enter words, which will be added into the story, which they cannot see before they
entered all the words. After entering all the words, the user is redirected to the next screen in which they can see the story 
including their own entered words. If they want, they can play another game by pressing the button at the bottom of the screen, which 
redirects the user to the home screen.
